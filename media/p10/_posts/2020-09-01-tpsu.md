                    The Temasek Polytechnic Studentsâ€™ Union (TPSU) is the largest student organisation in TP. Every TP student is automatically a member. Members are strongly encouraged to participate in the myriad of activities that TPSU has planned for the TP community. TPSU chairs the TP Students' Council, and they work closely with the Constituent Clubs to constantly find ways to engage students and develop a greater sense of belonging.<br>
