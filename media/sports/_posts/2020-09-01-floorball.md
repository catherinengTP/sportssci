                Developed in Scandinavia in the 1970s, floorball is a fast-paced sport played indoors with ’plastic’ sticks and a ball. Playing the stick above the waist is also against the rules, making it a relatively safe sport. Each game comprises three periods of 15 minutes and involves five players and a goalkeeper with rotating substitutions. TP Floorball teams (Men & Women) compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP) Floorball Games annually.<br>
