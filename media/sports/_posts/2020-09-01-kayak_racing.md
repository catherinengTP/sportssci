                Kayak racing is a water sport growing in popularity. The first kayaks were made of driftwood and animal skins by the natives of Asia and North America. Modern kayaks are made of metal, fiberglass and rubber, making them stronger, more durable and portable. TP Kayak Racing team competes in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) Canoe Sprints and external competitions annually.<br>
