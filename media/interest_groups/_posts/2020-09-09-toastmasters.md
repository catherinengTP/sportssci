                    TP Toastmasters (TPTM) is a non-profit educational organisation that teaches public speaking and leadership skills to members. In line with our motto “Where Leaders are made”, the TPTM trains members to build on their confidence and conquer their fear of public speaking through giving prepared speeches and evaluations. Good communication skills are also instilled through networking opportunities with other Toastmasters clubs in Singapore.<br>
