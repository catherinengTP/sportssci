<h4>LEAD Induction</h4>

The LEAD Induction programme was held over 5 runs for 415 LEAD students. Participants used the DISC profiling tool to better understanding their own and their teammatesâ€™ personality styles. They also underwent a team activity that allowed them to re-examine themselves and their values when under stress. The programme concluded with a sharing by invited guest panellists consisting of seniors and recent graduates on their LEAD journeys.

<h4>LEAD Heart</h4>

292 LEAD students and 75 staff from various departments attended the Temasek LEAD Heart that spanned over 2 full days on 1 & 8 October. In this run, 29 LEAD students stepped forward to co-create and co-organise the event with staff, in which they also served as facilitators in the breakout sessions.

The event touched on pertinent community issues revolving around the needs and social stigma faced by ex-offenders (Beyond Second Chances), people with mental health conditions (Is It Okay Not To Be Okay), special needs (Walking with Autism), and lastly the issues on  environmental sustainability in Singapore (The Zero Waste Lifestyle - A Concept or Reality). 

Participants were engaged in online discussions and sharing by speakers from Singapore Prison Service, Yellow Ribbon Project, National Council of Social Services, Singapore Association of Mental Health, Youth Corps Singapore, Tzu Chi Foundation, Zero Waste SG including Mr Izad Ghalid (HSS/PSY) and 2 alumni.

Based on students' feedback, the highlight of the event was the Human Library segment which allowed participants to engage the speakers more intimately in smaller groups. Our students were particularly interested in issues concerning ex-offenders and people with autism.  

At the end of the event, a handful of students signed up for volunteering or student-led service project initiatives.

At Temasek Polytechnic, we believe that talent is to be nurtured and every student must be given opportunities to achieve their personal best.

The Temasek LEADership Programme (Temasek LEAD) is an inclusive talent development programme for high-performing students. LEAD students can look forward to an amazing journey of self-discovery and enjoy exciting experiences that will take them beyond the classroom and academic pursuits. These include overseas academic exchanges, community service projects, local and overseas adventure expeditions, and more.

Temasek LEAD aims to develop LEAD students into future leaders with VISION, CHARACTER and HEART. Our unique approach is crafted to stretch the potential of our high-performing students. In Temasek LEAD, students can expect to embark on an exciting journey of self-discovery and holistic development to attain the following 4 key areas of leadership:

<h4>Personal Leadership</h4>
LEAD students will be developed to become effective leaders by raising their self-awareness, helping them understand their leadership profile and providing them with opportunities to lead from their strengths. Students will be provided opportunities to learn essential skills such as effective communication, planning and organising, problem solving, decision making and situational adaptability.

<h4>Team Leadership</h4>
LEAD students will be offered practice and experiential platforms to lead in challenging situations. They will acquire skills to organise teams, strengthen their awareness of teamwork and group dynamics, develop team resilience, conflict management and negotiation skills, emotional intelligence, and collaboration strategies. Exciting outdoor adventure programmes, including caving and white water rafting in various countries, will develop their capabilities to overcome team challenges.

h4>Community Leadership</h4>
LEAD students are given platforms to be actively engaged in leading service learning initiatives, both locally and overseas. The programme aims to groom compassionate leaders with a heart for others, who think beyond themselves and their immediate teams, to be socially responsible citizens, and to serve and care for their community.

<h4>Global Perspectives</h4>
Finally, LEAD students are provided opportunities to engage global and local government agencies, non-governmental organisations, industries, and educational institutions. They will develop 21st century competencies, such as critical and inventive thinking, global awareness and cross-cultural skills, change readiness, and an enterprising spirit; and be groomed to be adaptable future-oriented leaders. LEAD students can look forward to participating in immersive and intellectual symposiums such as those organised by the United Nations, local and overseas universities and agencies, as well as engagements with government officials, industry and thought leaders, and exchanges with peers across the world.

<h4>How Are The Programmes Run?</h4>
LEAD students will engage themselves in their leadership journey through a suite of programmes that are run in 3 main categories. These programmes are highly funded, with some overseas programmes funded as much as 90%. The (1) Core programmes ensure that participants are exposed to and developed in the 4 key areas of leadership espoused by Temasek LEAD.

In addition to the Core programmes, LEAD students will be offered a wide array of (2) Elective programmes, which would allow them the freedom to pursue leadership areas that match their personal needs and interests. 

Finally, Temasek LEAD offers a series of specially curated (3) Excel programmes to stretch our very best students, who have displayed outstanding achievements in the areas of academic studies, leadership roles and/or specialised talents.
