LEAD students will engage themselves in their leadership journey through a suite of programmes that are run in 3 main categories. These programmes are highly funded, with some overseas programmes funded as much as 90%. The Core programmes ensure that participants are exposed to and developed in the 4 key areas of leadership espoused by Temasek LEAD.
