    The Business Ambassadors (BA) is a group of students from all Business diplomas trained to undertake the smooth execution of events and functions hosted by the School of Business. Some of the key roles that BAs perform are emceeing, registration, crowd control, presenting and assisting in school talks and outreach exhibitions. The BAs have also participated in events such as Partners-in-Education, TP Graduation Ceremony and TP Open House. 
    <br><br>
    Training and networking sessions are usually held twice a year. Events that involve BAs happen at different times of the year, and ample notice will be given to the students.
