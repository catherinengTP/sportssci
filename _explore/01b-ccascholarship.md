### CCA Scholarship 2021 - Open for Application

![CCAScholarship2021](/images/ccascholarship-image.jpg)

The CCA Scholarship Scholarships are awarded to students who have contributed significantly to CCAs in the Polytechnic. Significant CCA contributions are taken into consideration in the selection process.

2020 has been an unprecedented year for our students and CCA groups. However, despite the curveballs that the pandemic has thrown, they have remained resilient and positive, made significant efforts to keep their CCA groups alive, and devised creative workarounds in ways previously unimaginable. In the process, they were also engaged and exposed to new skills and learning opportunities. 

We are happy to announce that the CCA Scholarship are now open for application from <b><u>7 May 2021 to 7 June 2021 (Monday), 11.59pm</u></b>. 

<b>The eligibility criteria and application process can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/isomerpages/tp-vc/raw/staging/images/attachment/ccascholarshipcriteria.pdf).</b><br>
