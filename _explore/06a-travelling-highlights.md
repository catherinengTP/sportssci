The ASEAN Student e-Xchange Programme is a virtual-mobility programme in partnership with Passage2ASEAN (P2A) Association. 43 TP students have been matched with 65 students from ASEAN, and over five weeks, they will engage in weekly 45-mins e-meetings to share and discuss their respective countries and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) while learning more from one another.

9 Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) from 5 countries participated in this programme - Universitas Kristen Indonesia Paulus (Indonesia), Universitas Pembangunan Nasional "Veteran" Yogyakarta (Indonesia), Technological University Kyaukse (Myanmar), Victoria University College (Myanmar), Saint Columban College (Philippines), Chiang Mai Rajabhat University (Thailand), Rangsit University (Thailand), Duy Tan University (Vietnam) and FPT Educational Global (Vietnam).

TP students engaged with their P2A counterparts, organised in groups of ten: five TP students and five P2A counterparts. Their e-exchange were held via MS Teams or any other e-platform of their choice.

The discussion revolved around selected UN SDGs: Good health and well-being; Quality education; Reduce inequalities; and, Partnership for the goals. The common thread weaving through these UN SDG was COVID-19. 

Through this programme, students will develop a global mindset, deepen cross-cultural skills, fostering cultural awareness and international collaboration.  Along the way; cultivating lasting friendships and at the end of the programme, the students will emerge with bigger hearts.
