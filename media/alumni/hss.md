### Industry Sharing by PSY Alumni ###
The Psychology Student Interest Group held an industry sharing session on 19 February 2021 for students from the diploma, which featured the following alumni speakers:

<ul>
  <li>Ms Jessalyn Soo – HR Advisor, UBS Bank of Singapore</li>
  <li>Ms Carrie Lee – Freelance Market Researcher</li>
  <li>Ms Vivian Ng – UX Designer</li>
  <li>Mr Wayne Koh – Executive (Leadership and Organisational Development Division), MOH Holdings Pte Ltd</li>
  <li>Ms Hannah Tan – Probation Officer, Ministry of Social and Family Development</li>
  <li>Ms Saloni Shirish Balekundri – Research Assistant, Centre for Research in Child Development, National Institute of Education</li>
  <li>Ms Shannon Siew – Teaching Assistant, St Andrew’s Autism School</li>
</ul>

The speakers shared many useful insights on their current vocations and what they did to get there, as well as their education and career choices/experiences. Through the session, our students also gained a newfound appreciation for the rigours of their diploma studies. Importantly, they learnt that psychology concepts can actually be applied across different industries too – even those that are not psychology-centric – such as UX (user experience) design and human resource.

It was definitely an inspiring and stimulating session, especially for the graduating cohort of students!
