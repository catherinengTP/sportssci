                Table tennis, also known as ping-pong, is another familiar sport in Singapore. Play is fast and demands quick reactions and movements, making it an exciting sport to watch as well. TP Table Tennis Teams (Men & Women) compete in the Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP) Table-Tennis Games annually.<br>
