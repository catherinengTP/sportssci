#### Welcome, Freshmen!

Congratulations on your successful enrolment to Temasek Polytechnic!

The Freshmen Orientation Programme or FOP, occupies a very special spot in TP’s calendar, as it not only celebrates a special milestone in your academic journey as you progress into tertiary education; it also marks the start of your journey in TP. And as like a rites-of-passage, this year’s FOP is an exciting platform to initiate and orientate about 4,600 of you from different secondary schools and institutions, varied backgrounds and experiences, and even from diverse countries into our one big TP Family. 

<u>Details of your registration, onboarding session time and venue will be communicated to you via mail, email or SMS.</u>
