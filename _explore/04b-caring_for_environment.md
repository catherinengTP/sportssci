At TP Green Interest Group, we organise environmental events such as beach clean-ups and hiking trips. In 2019, we were invited to join the R.I.S.E Champion Network together with many organisations such as the National Environment Agency and National Parks Boards. Through this, we met like-minded organisations that we could learn and collaborate with.
