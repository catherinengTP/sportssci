### Student Care Services ###

The Student Care team comprises of qualified counsellors who are always ready to lend a listening ear to the students' concerns and worries about academic progress, adjustment to life in a polytechnic, relationships or family problems. Students with financial difficulties can approach the counsellors for the various financial assistance schemes available in the polytechnic. Be it emotional, financial or social, we are right behind you in the journey of change and growth.

### E-Chat & Counselling Appointment ###

Due to the evolving risk on COVID-19 and the temporary Circuit Breaker measure, we are moving all counselling and support services online. Student can still make appointment using the link provided. However, counselling sessions will take place through Microsoft Teams (video Conference). In order to do that, we need you to use your official student email account (@tp.edu.sg) when making an appointment. Your counsellor will contact you via email to make arrangement on video call.

If you really feel the need to meet physically, perhaps you can drop us an email and we will contact you to explore further.
We have moved some workshops and training online as well. Please look out for it in the student announcements. These arrangements will continue until further notification is made. We apologise for the inconvenience but appeal to you for understanding.
