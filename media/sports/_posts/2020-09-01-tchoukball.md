                Tchoukball is an indoor team sport developed in the 1970s that is non-aggressive (non-contact and no intercept of passes) and reduces incidence of injuries while enabling people from all walks of life to enjoy the game. The sport is usually played on an indoor court with a trampoline goal frame at each end. Each team comprises 7 players and they can score at both ends of the court. In order to score a point, the ball must be thrown by an attacking player, hit the trampoline goal and bounce outside the goal zone (“D”) without being caught by the defending team.<br>
