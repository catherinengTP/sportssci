"A Caring Heart & Volunteering Spirit" is the motto that the TP Community Service Club (CSC) abides by. The CSC aims to instil the spirit of volunteerism in TP students and build a strong base of volunteers to serve the community. TP CSC had previously won Constituent Club of the Year consecutively for at least five years. Its members had also won Community Excellence Awards in recent years.

At TP Green Interest Group, we organise environmental events such as beach clean-ups and hiking trips. In 2019, we were invited to join the R.I.S.E Champion Network together with many organisations such as the National Environment Agency and National Parks Boards. Through this, we met like-minded organisations that we could learn and collaborate with. In July 2020, we organized the inaugural TP ECO Fest Campaign with participation from both students and staff.
