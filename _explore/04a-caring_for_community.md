### Project Helping Hands for Migrant Workers ###
“Project Helping Hands” is a new initiative by TP CSC aimed to raise awareness of the plight of migrant workers and at the same time instill a caring spirit in our volunteers. Special notes were posted online to encourage the migrant workers through this COVID-19 period. In addition, care packs of basic items were prepared and sent to these migrant workers in appreciate of their contributions to Singapore.
