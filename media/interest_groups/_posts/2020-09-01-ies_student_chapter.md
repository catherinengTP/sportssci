                    The Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES) is the premier engineering institution in Singapore and their views are often solicited by the Government to feedback on professional engineering matters. As one of its 11 student chapters in Singapore, TP IES Student Chapterâ€™s objectives are:<br>
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advancing and promoting the art, science and profession of engineering</li>
                        <li>Providing a platform for engineering students in Singapore to network</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Students are involved in organising workshops and industry visits, attending engineering-related professional conferences and community service projects, or supporting overseas student exchange programmes.<br>
