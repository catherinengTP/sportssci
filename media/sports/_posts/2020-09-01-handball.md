                Handball is a team sport in which two teams of six outcourt players and one goalkeeper pass the ball around with the objective of throwing it into the goal of the opposing team. The game consists of two halves of 30 minutes each and the team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. TP Handball (Men) team competes in external competitions annually.<br>
