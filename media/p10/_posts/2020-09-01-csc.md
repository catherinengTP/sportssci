                    "A Caring Heart & Volunteering Spirit" is the motto that the TP Community Service Club (CSC) abides by. The CSC aims to instil the spirit of volunteerism in TP students and build a strong base of volunteers to serve the community.  Some of the annual campus-wide volunteering events that it organises include the Walk for Rice @ TP, 3M Step-Up Challenge @ TP and Hair For Hope @ TP. Other long term projects include Volunteering @ MINDs, IMH and YEAH! (Youths Engaged Active and Healthy) Programme @ Tampines West CC.  If you have a heart for the community and want to pay it forward, come join TP CSC as a member now!<br>
