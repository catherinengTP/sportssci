### Industry Sharing by PSY Alumni ###
The Psychology Student Interest Group held an industry sharing session on 19 February 2021 for students from the diploma, which featured the following alumni speakers:

<ul>
  <li>Week of Welcome for international freshmen</li>
  <li>National Integration Council's award-winning Global Community Day</li>
  <li>D.I.Y (Diversity. Inclusion. You.) programme</li>
  <li>Campus Care Network (CCN) Day</li>
  <li>Local Festivals and Celebrations</li>
  <li>Community Service</li>
  <li>Leadership development</li>
  <li>Inter-polytechnic events such as One Heart, Youth Model ASEAN Conference, Cross-Cultural Symposium, Workplace Integration In Action</li>
</ul>

The speakers shared many useful insights on their current vocations and what they did to get there, as well as their education and career choices/experiences. Through the session, our students also gained a newfound appreciation for the rigours of their diploma studies. Importantly, they learnt that psychology concepts can actually be applied across different industries too – even those that are not psychology-centric – such as UX (user experience) design and human resource.

It was definitely an inspiring and stimulating session, especially for the graduating cohort of students!
