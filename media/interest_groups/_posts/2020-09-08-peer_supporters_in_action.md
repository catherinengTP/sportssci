                    Peer Supporters-in-Action aims to equip students with the knowledge about mental health so that anyone can be a supporter to their fellow peers.<br>
                    <br>
                    PSIA also strives to provide a safe platform for all students to feel comfortable about sharing their stories with one another. Activities and programs are held in an effort to create a friendlier environment in TP and to raise awareness about mental health.<br>
                    <br>
                    Students are all welcome to join us in this peer support movement.<br>
