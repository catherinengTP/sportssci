"A Caring Heart & Volunteering Spirit" is the motto that the TP Community Service Club (CSC) abides by. The CSC aims to instil the spirit of volunteerism in TP students and build a strong base of volunteers to serve the community. TP CSC had previously won Constituent Club of the Year consecutively for at least five years. Its members had also won Community Excellence Awards in recent years.
