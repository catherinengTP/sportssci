### Temasek Student Excellence Awards 2021

The Temasek Student Excellence Awards (TSEA) are presented annually to recognise the inspiring achievements and outstanding contributions of students in non-academic areas, such as arts, sports, leadership, service, entrepreneurship and character excellence.

2020 has been an unprecedented year for our students and CCA groups. However, despite the curveballs that the pandemic has thrown, they have remained resilient and positive, made significant efforts to keep their CCA groups alive, and devised creative workarounds in ways previously unimaginable. In the process, they were also engaged and exposed to new skills and learning opportunities. 

We are happy to announce that nominations for the TSEA are now open! In view of the COVID-19 situation, the TSEA Secretariat has also modified some of our usual award categories to facilitate your nominations. Nonetheless, the spirit of TSEA remains in celebrating excellent student contributions. 

Do take a moment to uplift your studentsâ€™ spirits, and give them a pat on the back for their amazing dedication, selfless sacrifice and inspiring leadership. 

Nominate them for the TSEA today! 

<b>Announcement</b><br>
Nominations for the TSEA are open <b><u>from now till 31 May 2021 (Monday), 11.59pm</u></b>. Please refer to the full list of awards, as well as the eligibility criteria, nomination process and submission forms/links below.
