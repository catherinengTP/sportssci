<h3>Do I need to attach SEAL records?</h3>

No, you do not need to attach SEAL records as the TSEA Secretariat will retrieve the studentsâ€™ SEAL records to audit your nominations. However, please state supporting events/projects/competitions (as per AY2020/2021 SEAL records) clearly in the nomination forms. 

<h3>Will I be notified on the outcome of my nominations?</h3>

The TSEA Secretariat will inform staff of both successful and unsuccessful nominees. 

<h3>Is an external CCA such as NPCC considered?</h3>
No, only TP-registered CCAs are eligible for the awards, unless specified otherwise in the criteria.

<h3>How do you judge the scale of an event? Is an organiser of an Interest Group BBQ equivalent to an organiser of a concert?</h3>

Some considerations in judging the scale of events include the number of participants, the profile of the invited guests, the impact of the event and the magnitude of the event (e.g. poly-wide, nation-wide, diploma-wide, class).

<h3>Can students submit the nomination form themselves?</h3>

No, only TP staff can submit the nominations via the prescribed nomination forms. Those submitted directly by the students/nominees are deemed as not supported by TP staff, and will hence not be accepted.

<h3>Can a TP staff be nominated for the Outstanding Coach/Instructor Award?</h3>

No, this award is only applicable to an external, officially-appointed TP coach or instructor.

<h3>How do I know whether my nomination form has been received?</h3>

The TSEA Secretariat will send you an acknowledgement email within 3 working days upon receiving your nomination. Please email <a href="mailto:tsea@tp.edu.sg">tsea@tp.edu.sg</a> if no acknowledgement email was received.
