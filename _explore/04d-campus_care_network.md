### Campus Care Network Day ###
<div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>
Established in 1991, <a href="https://www.tp.edu.sg/life-at-tp/a-caring-campus.html#campus-care-network" target="_blank">Campus Care Network (CCN)</a> has been instrumental in developing personal contact and rapport between lecturers and students, creating a family-like environment, and maintaining a caring culture so as to ensure students' personal growth.  
    </p>
    <p>
TP's inaugural Virtual Campus Care Network Day held in conjunction with TP National Day Virtual Concert was meant to raise funds for our needy students especially during this current pandemic.
