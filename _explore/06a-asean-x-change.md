The ASEAN Student e-Xchange Programme is a virtual-mobility programme in partnership with Passage2ASEAN (P2A) Association. 44 TP students have been matched with 45 students from ASEAN, and over five weeks, they will engage in weekly 45-mins e-meetings to share and discuss their respective countries and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) while learning more from one another.


<i>"The concept of Student e-Xchange Programme is not new, given the technology to facilitate the programme has existed for years.  In light of Covid-19 pandemic, overseas student programmes have been on a standstill. Like all institutions of higher learning throughout the world, we had to re-imagine how do we conduct overseas student programmes. The ASEAN Student e-Xchange Programme is our response to the situation. 

Through this programme, students will develop a global mindset, deepen cross-cultural skills, fostering cultural awareness and international collaboration.  Along the way; cultivating lasting friendships and at the end of the programme, the students will emerge with bigger hearts.  

We look forward to a warm virtual hand-shake with our ASEAN counterparts."</i>
