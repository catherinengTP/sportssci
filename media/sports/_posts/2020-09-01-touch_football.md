                Players in touch football do not tackle in the traditional physical way, as in rugby. Instead, players use their hands to touch their opponents on any part of the body, clothing, or the ball. Sometimes, referred to as Touch Rugby, it is a safe and growing sport among young men and women in Singapore. It is easy to learn and generally played with two teams of six on-field players. TP Touch Football team competes in Polytechnic-ITE (POL-ITE) and Institute-Varsity Polytechnic (IVP) Touch Football Games annually.<br>
