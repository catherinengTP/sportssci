Being a champion in caring for the environment and sustainability, TP Green Interest Group organized several environmental events such as beach clean-ups and hiking trips. In 2019, the group was invited to join the R.I.S.E Champion Network together with many organisations such as the National Environment Agency and National Parks Boards.
