Nominations for the TSEA are open from now till <b>31 May 2021 (Monday), 11.59pm</b>. Nominations received after the deadline will strictly not be accepted.
Only TP CCAs registered with the Student Development & Alumni Affairs Department are eligible for the TSEA.

For the CCA Dedication Awards (Individual), CCA advisors are to submit their nominations via the prescribed nomination form to the TSEA Secretariat at: <a href="mailto:tsea@tp.edu.sg">tsea@tp.edu.sg</a>. Only electronic submissions will be accepted.

For the Outstanding CCA Contributions Awards (Individual & Group/Team), Individual Higher Awards, Group/Team Higher Awards, and Outstanding Coach/Instructor Award, nominations must be submitted by TP staff via the official online forms. 

Only nominations submitted through the email accounts of TP staff will be accepted. Nominations sent from a student/nominee's email address are deemed as not supported by TP staff, and will hence not be accepted.

It is the TP staff’s responsibility to verify the accuracy of all information, including the nominees’ SEAL records, before submitting their nominations.
